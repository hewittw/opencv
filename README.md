# opencv

Welcome to Hewitt's Open CV Project

cvProject.py and the faces folder are the only actual files needed for my final project. You will have to install the face_recognition and tesseract libraries too.

# Things to look for

Basically, I got a little carried away from the textbook and had a blast. For things from the textbook, I use a lot of concepts from Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 in order to read in the face images, use and display video from the laptop camera, and output edited 'video footage' (lots of images). For the rest of the chapter requirements that are not fulfilled from above, Dr. J said my work with face_recognition and tesseract covered it. I learned a lot about both libraries (a bit about how they work and a ton about how to use them), and just a lot about getting to libraries to work in general. It was tons of fun.
